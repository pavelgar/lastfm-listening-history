# Last.fm listening history

Here I prototype an interactive data visualization web app,
which shows my music listening history from [last.fm](https://last.fm).
The visualization shows a streamgraph of artists and their relative popularity each week. Viewers can zoom in on a particular time period to explore the data in more detail.
